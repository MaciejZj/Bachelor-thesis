# Copper-grains-classification

My bachelor's thesis covering the topic of copper ore grains classification
based on thermal images.
The project includes data analysis and feature extraction from footage acquired
using active thermography approach.
The copper grains are characterised by tracking the number of spots with lower
thermal emissivity.
Classification algorithm utilizes a neural network developed with Keras
interface.
The document can be viewed [here](https://github.com/MaciejZj/Bachelors-thesis/blob/master/thesis.pdf).

Feel free to check out the
[project repository](https://github.com/MaciejZj/Copper-grains-classification),
to examine the implementation.
